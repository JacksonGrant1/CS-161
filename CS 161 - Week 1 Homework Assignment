#cs-161 HW assignment 1

#1: Print your petâ€™s type and name using an f-String.

pet_type = "cat"
pet_name = "Pickles"
print(f'I have a {pet_type} and their name is {pet_name}.')

#2: Use input statements to take input and an f-String to print the results as shown.

name = input("Enter your name: ")
age = input("Enter your age: ")
savings = input("Enter your yearly savings: ")

print(f"Hello {name}! You are currently {age} years old. If you save ${savings} each year, in 5 years\
 you will have saved ${(int(savings) * 5)}. Your average monthly savings is ${(int(savings)/12): .2f}.")

#3: Use an f-String to print out the number of seconds in the current month.  Have Python do the multiplication.


months = {
    1: "January",
    2: "February",
    3: "March",
    4: "April",
    5: "May",
    6: "June",
    7: "July",
    8: "August",
    9: "September",
    10: "October",
    11: "November",
    12: "December"}

import calendar
import datetime

date = datetime.datetime.now()
month = date.month
year = date.year

weekday, days = calendar.monthrange(year, month)

print(f'The number of seconds in {months[month]} is {(days*24*60*60)}.')

#4: Use the // operator for integer division and % for the integer remainder.

eggs = int(input('Enter your number of eggs: '))

doz_eggs = eggs // 12
left_eggs = eggs % 12

print(f'This makes {doz_eggs} dozen eggs with {left_eggs} left over.')
